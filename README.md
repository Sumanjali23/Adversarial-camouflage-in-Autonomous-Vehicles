## How to run (Colab)
1. Open a notebook using one of the links above.
2. Run the setup cells to install dependencies.
3. Download the dataset (see below) and put it under `data/`.

## Data (not stored in this repo)
Large datasets and weights are **excluded** from git (`data/`, `runs/`, `weights/` are ignored).

**Option A â€“ Google Drive via gdown**
```python
!pip install -q gdown
DATA_ID = "PASTE_YOUR_DRIVE_FILE_ID"
!gdown --id {DATA_ID} -O data.zip
!unzip -q data.zip -d data/
```
## Run locally (optional)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
